# calculator

A Clojurescript Web application that is a very simple web calculator. This is a beginner project to test out the process of building a
Clojurescript application.

## Usage

This was for my training and hopefully somebody else might find it useful and/or enlightening.

The implementation uses the ability to put functions into a map and then pass that around like data.

The size of the resulting code is about 111k of javascript in advanced mode. In pretty print mode it is about 1.3 meg.

This is a small application so the base code is larger than the code that was compiled from mine, so I am not to worried about the size. What
I am pleased about is how little code I had to write to accomplish the task. The map construct saved a substantial amount of code.
